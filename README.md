# Useful Scripts Repository

This repository contains a collection of useful scripts that I have written or worked on. These scripts cover various tasks, such as generating JWT secret keys and other general-purpose tools. The goal of this repository is to provide reusable code snippets and utilities for different use cases.

## Contents

- **[JWT Secret Key Generator](jwt-key-generator/)**: A simple script to generate secret keys for JSON Web Tokens (JWT) using the HS256 and HS512 algorithms. This script helps you easily generate secure base64-encoded keys for your JWTs.
